 - Designed to provide the user with recipes they can make once they put in a recipe and
narrow it down by cuisine or diet. It is also very helpful in the time of covid where many rely on uber eats to take out food.
The application in it's complete form would allow the user to scan ingredients around their house an an alternative to manually entering them in.
This would use Google Cloud Vision which would use AI that would recognize the item and add it to the database of ingredients.
##### Instructions:
 1. User would go to home page and click on the add ingredients button where there will be
a text box.

be told if they need any additional ingredients for the particular recipe.

##### Technologies Used
1. **spoonacular API** - provided with recipes once ingredients and paramateres were
added

2. **Vue.js** - in order to make front end work easier

3. **node.js** - language in which this was coded

4. **VsCode **- main coding platform

5. **PostgreSQL** - database for the project

6. **ngrok** - used for port forwarding

7. **Insomina** - Rest API tester

8. **Axios** - to make request to the server

9. **Express JS** - Processing Incoming requests

10. **Apache Cordova** - make web apps run as mobile apps combined with vue.

11. **Github** - for version control
